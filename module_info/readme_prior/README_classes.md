AbstractPDFManager takes a path to a PDF file as an input, and provides methods to split the PDF into individual pages, convert the pages into images, extract text from images, run bulk OCR extraction, run slice-aware OCR, and handle manifests. The last two methods orchestrate the complete process of text extraction from PDFs: one performing the basic extraction (split, conversion, extraction), and the other doing the full pipeline, optionally including the slice-aware OCR.*n**n*Examples of how to use the class are provided in the doc string."

The script primarily contains import statements from various Python packages and modules. It extensively uses hints for improved type-checking and to annotate the types of variables used in the code. It imports various elements such as Image from PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing, Path from pathlib for filesystem path handling, and more from other packages like abstract_ocr, pdf2image, os, shutil, hashlib, re, logging, PyPDF2, and abstract_utilities. The purpose of these imports, as can be inferred from their individual capacities, would be to carry out various image processing, OCR conversions, PDF handling, file manipulation, logging, regular expressions, and other utility tasks. It also sets up a logger with the name 'abstract_pdf', which could be used to log events or errors while the module functions are performed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_pdfs/imports/manifest_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Manifest_Utils_Py_Script_Description_in_Abstract_PDFs_Package\n was described as: The provided script is manifest_utils.py, a part of the abstract_pdfs package, which primarily contains functions related to handling and managing manifests (structured data describing package contents). The functions include getting the path and directory of a PDF, getting the path of a manifest, loading an existing manifest, and saving a manifest data. The get_pdf_path and get_pdf_dir functions either return the path to the PDF file or obtain the directory of the PDF respectively. The get_manifest_path function generates the path for the manifest file corresponding to a PDF. The load_manifest function reads a manifest file and returns the JSON data. The function takes either a directory containing PDFs or the actual path to a manifest as input. If a manifest doesn't exist in the provided location, it creates an empty manifest. The save_manifest_data function writes data to a manifest file. Directed by the optional 'override' parameter, if set to 'True', the function reloads an existing manifest within the given directory and otherwise, it creates an empty file.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nClasses_And_APIs"

The 'images_to_pdf' function combines multiple images into a single PDF file; this page extraction method is used in the 'process_pdf' function which also encapsulates the full pipeline of operations including splitting PDF into single page PDFs, converting each page to PNG, extracting, cleaning, preprocessing and saving different forms of text data.

As no specific classes have been mentioned or described, I'll consider each Python script as a class with the script's functionalities as its methods.\\n\\n1. #### PDF_To_Text_Script\\nIn the `abstract_pdfs` package, the `pdf_to_text.py` in the `pdf_utils` directory is considered as 'PDF_To_Text_Script' class. \\n   - `is_pdf_file`: Verifies if a file is a pdf based on its extension.\n   - `get_file_hash`: Calculates the hash of a file's contents.\n   - `get_preferred_filename`: Finds an unsuffixed or lower-numbered name among duplicates.\n   - `get_pdf_obj`: Returns a PyPDF2.PdfReader object from a pdf file path.\n   - `save_pdf`: Writes a PyPDF2 writer object to disk.\n   - `split_pdf`: Splits a pdf into separate pages, each as a separate file.\n   - `pdf_to_text_in_folders`: Converts PDFs to text and save results in individual folders.\\n\\n2. #### PDF_Tools_Script\\nThe `pdf_tools.py` script in 'abstract_pdfs' package is considered as 'PDF_Tools_Script' class. \\n   - `images_to_pdf`: Combines multiple images into a single PDF file.\n   - `process_pdf`: It encapsulates the full pipeline of operations including splitting PDF into single-page PDFs, converting each page to PNG, extracting, cleaning, preprocessing, and saving different forms of text data.\", \"generate_title\": \"Classes_And_API_For_Abstract_PDFs_Module_Part_2\"}",
