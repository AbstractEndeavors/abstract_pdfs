 dubbed with the title: Manifest_Utils_Py_Script_Description_in_Abstract_PDFs_Package
 was described as: The provided script is manifest_utils.py, a part of the abstract_pdfs package, which primarily contains functions related to handling and managing manifests (structured data describing package contents). The functions include getting the path and directory of a PDF, getting the path of a manifest, loading an existing manifest, and saving a manifest data. The get_pdf_path and get_pdf_dir functions either return the path to the PDF file or obtain the directory of the PDF respectively. The get_manifest_path function generates the path for the manifest file corresponding to a PDF. The load_manifest function reads a manifest file and returns the JSON data. The function takes either a directory containing PDFs or the actual path to a manifest as input. If a manifest doesn't exist in the provided location, it creates an empty manifest. The save_manifest_data function writes data to a manifest file. Directed by the optional 'override' parameter, if set to 'True', the function reloads an existing manifest within the given directory and otherwise, it creates an empty file.
