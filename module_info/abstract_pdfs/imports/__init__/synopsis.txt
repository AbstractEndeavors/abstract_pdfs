 in the script: src/abstract_pdfs/imports/__init__.py
 dubbed with the title: Init_Py_Script_for_Imports_and_Manifest_Utils_in_Abstract_PDFs_Package_Description
 was described as: The presented script '__init__.py' from the abstract_pdfs package, is written to initialize the package 'abstract_pdfs'. It is relatively simple and only contains two lines of code. Firstly it imports from '.imports', which likely includes various necessary project-specific modules or libraries required within this package. Secondly it imports from '.manifest_utils', which would be necessary for handling and managing manifests (structured data describing package contents) within the package. Hence, it makes the imports and manifest_utils modules functionalities accessible for use within 'abstract_pdfs' package.
