 dubbed with the title: AbstractPDFManager_Class_Description
 was described as: The script creates a Python class called AbstractPDFManager within the abstract_pdfs package. The class is responsible for managing operations on PDF files such as file ingestion, deduplication, splitting, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) conversion, and text extraction with awareness of slices or parts of the PDF document.*n**n*The class uses utilities provided in the same package, such as various tools for handling PDFs and extracting text from them, as well as the SliceManager class for slice-aware column detection. AbstractPDFManager takes a path to a PDF file as an input, and provides methods to split the PDF into individual pages, convert the pages into images, extract text from images, run bulk OCR extraction, run slice-aware OCR, and handle manifests. The last two methods orchestrate the complete process of text extraction from PDFs: one performing the basic extraction (split, conversion, extraction), and the other doing the full pipeline, optionally including the slice-aware OCR.*n**n*Examples of how to use the class are provided in the doc string.
