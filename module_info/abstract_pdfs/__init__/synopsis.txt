 dubbed with the title: Init_Py_Script_in_Abstract_PDFs_Package_Overview
 was described as: The provided script '__init__.py' from the abstract_pdfs package is responsible for the initialization of the package, importing the necessary modules and classes required within the module. It imports everything from 'pdf_utils', which likely include utilities for handling .pdf files; from 'imports', which are likely project-specific modules or libraries; from 'SliceManager', which is a class dedicated to managing operations for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on PDF files with specific focus on column-aware OCR and text cleaning; and from 'AbstractPDFManager', which is a class for managing operations on PDF files such as file ingestion, deduplication, splitting, OCR conversion, and text extraction. By doing so, it makes these classes and functions available for use within the package.
