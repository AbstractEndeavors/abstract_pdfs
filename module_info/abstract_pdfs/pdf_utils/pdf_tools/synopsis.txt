 dubbed with the title: PDF_Tools_Script_in_Abstract_PDFs_Package_Description
 was described as: The script pdf_tools.py from the 'abstract_pdfs' package offers standalone utilities for PDF page extraction, image conversion, and text preprocessing. The script relies on dependencies such as PyPDF2, pdf2image, PIL, abstract_utilities, abstract_ocr. The script defines two main functions: 'images_to_pdf' and 'process_pdf'. The 'images_to_pdf' function combines multiple images into a single PDF file; this page extraction method is used in the 'process_pdf' function which also encapsulates the full pipeline of operations including splitting PDF into single page PDFs, converting each page to PNG, extracting, cleaning, preprocessing and saving different forms of text data. The client version releases a folder structure containing unique directories to store processed pdf pages, images, cleaned texts and preprocessed images and texts.
