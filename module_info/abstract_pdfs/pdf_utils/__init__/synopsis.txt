 in the script: src/abstract_pdfs/pdf_utils/__init__.py
 dubbed with the title: Initialization_of_PDF_Utils_in_Abstract_PDFs
 was described as: The provided chunk is a part of '__init__.py' in the 'pdf_utils' subpackage of 'abstract_pdfs'. This script is responsible for initializing the 'pdf_utils' subpackage within 'abstract_pdfs', allowing for access to utilities related to PDF handling. The script imports everything from 'pdf_to_text' and 'pdf_tools'. 'pdf_to_text' is most likely a module that provides functionalities for converting PDF files to text, which would be vitally useful when working with Optical Character Recognition techniques, and 'pdf_tools' likely provides a set of tools and utilities necessary for performing various operations on PDF files. By importing everything from these two modules, the script makes available a range of PDF-to-text conversion and PDF manipulation functionalities for use within the 'pdf_utils' subpackage.
